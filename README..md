# Autonomous Light Finder-Follower Robotic Vehicle

This is a project for the Mechatronics and Robot Modelling and Control unit at the UoB.

* The Robotic vehicle can follow the light, detect the obstacles, display information about calibration processes and display temperature and humidity.
* The stages of the program are controlled by the button. 
* The calibration of the light threeshold and dc motors's speed is done manually by the potentiometer.
